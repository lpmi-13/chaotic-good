# Unnamed Node Service

I have no idea what this service will do, but wanted to set one up following the excellent [guide](https://www.learnwithjason.dev/blog/modern-node-server-typescript-2024) from Jason Lengstorf.

It most likely will enventually be instrumented to send opentelemetry data, and will also probably be containerized.
